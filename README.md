# NeuralNetworks-PortfolioProjects
Hi, these are all the projects I did in Neural Networks

---

**String-to-Vectors (STV) an Index Class Implementation:** This repository contains the implementation for the String-to-Vectors (STV) assignment. The project focuses on constructing a robust mapping system between arbitrary vocabulary items and numerical representations such as index vectors, binary vectors, index matrices, and binary matrices. This work is guided by automated testing similar to real-world ML workflow validation.

**Back Propagation:** This project implements a simple fully connected feed-forward neural network with sigmoid activations. The model supports forward propagation, binary prediction, gradient computation via backpropagation, and weight updates via gradient descent.

**Feedforward Networks:** A structured neural-network implementation created to satisfy the constraints of a fixed testing framework. The project produced multiple model variants like deep, wide, dropout, no-dropout, early-stopping, and no-early-stopping and all models were validated exclusively through non-editable automated tests.
